/**
 * Provides Custom view classes and related elements. Incomplete. Was Originally
 * Developed Ma'aadh Shaan. However, we never managed to get him back to the
 * project to complete it and it is really far behind. From my assesment, I
 * think that it would take a fare amount of development efforts to get it beck
 * to an usable level. My assessment is based on comparison of it with semi
 * custom view at the end of the 2010 project and the amount of work I had to do
 * to get SCV to where it is now over the past six months. With consultation
 * with my supervisors, it was decided that I am to leave the custom view source
 * code here with a note of what I have done. I haven't done absolutely anything
 * to custom view. - Nahid Akbar on 2011-07-07
