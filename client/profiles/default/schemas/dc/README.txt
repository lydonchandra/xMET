Modified DC XML Schema by Nahid Akbar.

These are not my original schemas. Original schemas with original comments and
what not can be found in the sibling folder. Modified for "structured" 
implementation as required for xMET. This should compatible with the metadata 
records produced to validate against the original schemas. Stripped original 
documentation as users should refer to original schemas for reference to 
original documentation.
